Terminal identification and feature status.

This module contains a number of classes that culminate in the
:class:`TerminalAwareness` class. The support code is separated into the
following classes:

:class:`TerminalPreset`
    Presets allow applications to work with high-level concepts without having
    to check if each interesting feature is implemented or not. They are not
    directly related to :class:`TerminalFeature` objects, more to the needs of
    the color ingredient defined in :mod:`guacamole.ingredients.color`.  The
    module-level constants can be identified by the ``PRESET_`` prefix.

:class:`TerminalFeature`
    Feature objects describe a single terminal capability. Currently all the
    features are related to ANSI SGR commands needed by the color ingredient.
    Later on additional features may be added, e.g. for non-canonical mode and
    other things that might help to improve the `textland` project.  The
    module-level constants can be identified by the ``ANSI_`` prefix.

:class:`TerminalFeatureStatus`
    Status objects describe the state of implementation of particular features.
    There are just a few possible statuses but they all carry additional
    information useful to some applications. The module-level constants can be
    identified by the ``STATUS_`` prefix.

:class:`TerminalProfile`
    Profile objects contain data and APIs needed to detect a particular
    implementation of a terminal emulator. They are never instantiated.
    Information that they provide is used to create instances of
    :class:`Terminal` objects.

:class:`Terminal`
    Read-only information about the terminal. Exposes all the features and
    their implementation status. This is what the :class:`TerminalAwareness`
    inserts into the context as the ``ctx.terminal`` object.

    the numerous little features, compatibilities and bugs. Instead having to
    check if a particular feature is supported you can just look at the preset.
    Since there are just a few presets (way less than combination of features
    and their statuses) this provides a far easier approach to doing
    conditional rendering in applications.

    On the inside of guacamole they help the color controller set good defaults
    for how the color palette is supposed to lookup colors. Guacamole has
    several "color types" that correspond to various features implemented by
    particular terminal emulators.

PRESET_PRIMITIVE = TerminalPreset("primitive", _("primitive terminal"), 0)

#: Terminal preset for common terminals.
#:
#: Common terminals support way more features and typically provide at least
#: 256-color palette, bold and a few other text styles. Most terminal emulators
#: that people actually use will be compatible with this preset. Notable
#: examples are: Putty, Apple's Terminal.app, older versions of xterm,
#  Gnome Terminal and the KDE Konsole.
PRESET_COMMON = TerminalPreset("common", _("common terminal"), 1)

#: Terminal preset for modern terminals.
#:
#: Modern terminals support almost all the features possible but are typically
#: exclusively available on the most recent versions of various Linux
#: distributions. One of the distinguishing features is the ability to access
#: the true color palette. Modern terminals also have less bugs and generally
#: work better in every situation then their less-capable brethren. Notable

        or ``ctx.ansi()``. This is meant to serve as a testing feature. Please
        have a look at the example program ``examples/terminal.py`` for
        inspiration on how to take advantage of this in your applications.

    Each terminal feature object is hashable (it hashes to the same value as
    the slug does). When converted to a string it becomes the name of the
    feature.

    Inside a guacamole-based application you can safely hard-code strings that
    correspond to slug of particular features you care about. Those are
    promised to be maintained forever as a part of the public API.

        terminals to efficiently provide this information, even across SSH (but
        only if everything is configured correctly, currently this is not true
        on an system).

        as described by :attr:`version_query_cmd`. The output (combined stdout
        and stderr) is then matched to the :attr:`version_pattern` regular
        expression and the first unnamed group from that expression is used as
        the return value. Both of those attributes need to be provided for this
        code to be active.

    A terminal (emulator).

    Terminal object exposes the following information about the terminal
    emulator program that a guacamole-based application is running on.

    The terminal is described by these attributes:

    :ivar slug:
        Unique identifier of the terminal emulator program. Those identifiers
        are assigned by guacamole developers. They are not related to any
        upstream identification systems.

    :ivar name:
        Name of the terminal emulator program. This is always a human-readable,
        translated version of the name.

    :ivar version:
        Version of the terminal emulator program. This property is rarely
        available. This is sometimes None (some terminals don't provide this
        information).

    :ivar preset:
        Terminal feature preset that this terminal is mostly compatible with.
        This is always one of :attr:`PRESET_PRIMITIVE`, :attr:`PRESET_COMMON`
        or :attr:`PRESET_MODERN`.

    :ivar features:
        A mapping from features (:class:`TerminalFeature`) to support status
        (:class:`TerminalFeatureStatus`). For simplicity it can be indexed with
        regular strings, by the identifier of each feature, e.g.
        ``"ansi-font-bold"``. The support status is always one of values:

        :attr:`STATUS_CONFIGURABLE`, :attr:`STATUS_SUPPORTED` or
        :attr:`STATUS_UNKNOWN`. Again for simplicity those also compare to

    """
    Ingredient for detecting features of the terminal emulator.

    This ingredient is responsible for detecting the terminal used by the
    application using guacamole and exposing relevant information about the
    terminal through the context.

    This ingredient also collaborates behind the scenes with the color
    controller ingredient to ensure that colors just work, if possible, and
    that colors are gracefully degrading on less capable emulators.

    Applications can access the terminal object explicitly. This can be useful
    for applications that simply depend on certain feature for proper
    functionality. Please familiarize yourself with the :class:`Terminal`
    object and various features and status objects linked from therein.

    One simple way of treating terminals is to look at the
    :attr:`Terminal.preset` attribute. It provides a simple generalization of
    what kind of terminal is being used at the moment.

    If the terminal preset is :attr:`PRESET_PRIMITIVE` then you can do very
    little with the terminal. Here various rendering hints should be
    non-essential as they will often not work at all.

    If the terminal preset is :attr:`PRESET_COMMON`, which is true for most
    actually commonly used terminal emulators, except Windows, then you can use
    many features without issues. Here visual hints can play an important role
    in your application.

    Lastly if the terminal preset is :attr:`PRESET_MODERN` then you have extra
    visual fidelity available at your disposal. Please note that applications
    that depend on such features will run almost exclusively on modern Linux
    distributions and when using a mainstream Linux terminal emulator. In other
    words Windows, OS X and some older Linux distributions are not supported.

    Lastly, remember that Guacamole tries to help you. The color controller
    will successfully hide many issues related to the handling of colors across
    environments. If that is your only need then you can never touch the
    terminal object. Everything will be done automatically behind the scenes.
