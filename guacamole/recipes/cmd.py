Recipe for using guacamole to run commands.

This module contains sock recipes for guacamole. Stock recipes allow
application developers to use use simple-to-understand design patterns to get
predictable runtime behiavior.

Currently, guacamole ships with two such recipes, for creating simple commands
and for creating hierarhical command groups. They are captured by the
:class:`Command` and :class:`Group` classes respectively.

    Single purpose commands are the most commonly known tools in command line

    terminal emulator or other command line environment specific to a given
    operating system.

    To create a new command simply create a custom class and override the
    :meth:`invoked()` method. Put all of your custom code there. If you want to
    interact with command line arguments then please also override the
    :meth:`register_arguments()` method.

    Have a look at example applications for details of how to do this. You can
